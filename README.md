# Technical Support System

## ðŸ”¹ Project Title & Topic
A modern technical support system designed to streamline customer service operations and improve response times. This system provides an integrated platform for managing support tickets, customer interactions, and knowledge base articles.

## ðŸ”¹ Expected Results
- Efficient ticket management and routing
- Improved response times through automated workflows
- Better customer satisfaction through organized support processes
- Reduced resolution time through knowledge base integration
- Analytics and reporting for support team performance

## ðŸ”¹ Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **OS Requirements**: Linux/macOS/Windows
- **Dependencies**: See requirements.txt

## ðŸ”¹ Code Style
This project follows PEP 8 style guide for Python code and ESLint with Airbnb style guide for TypeScript/JavaScript code. All code should be properly formatted and documented.

### Linter and Static Analysis Tool Justification
- **Black**: Used for automatic code formatting. Black enforces a consistent code style and is widely adopted in the Python community. It may allow lines longer than 79 characters for readability, which is a common modern practice.
- **flake8**: Used for code linting and style checking. flake8 enforces PEP 8 compliance and helps catch common style issues and potential bugs. Some line length warnings (E501) may be ignored in favor of Black's formatting.
- **mypy**: Used for static type checking. mypy helps catch type-related bugs early and enforces type annotations, improving code quality and maintainability.

All three tools are integrated into the CI workflow and reports are saved in the `static_analysis/` directory.
